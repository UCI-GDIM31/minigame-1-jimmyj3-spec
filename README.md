## Devlog
I think components, GameObjects, and Scenes can be compared to a supermarket. Components are like goods and food. They are always there, and we will grab them once we need them. Each item has a purpose, but a single item by itself doesn't make the supermarket meaningful. GameObjects are like different areas in the supermarket. The area becomes distinct because of the items placed on it. Just like we are buying ice cream, we will find it in the freezer section. The gameobjects always partner up with components; it becomes useful and recognizable when it is filled with components. The scene can be considered as the whole supermarket. The supermarkets make sense when everything is organized. And the scene is the same, what makes it unique is the components and gameobjects we have in the scene, and it brings players a unique experience.
